P.S: This should also not go against their TOS, because i have not implemented mass consecutive downloading. (If you are the website creator and do want me to take this down, i will, please email me.)

## Overview

This application simplifies downloading OST music from Kingdom Hearts Insider (`downloads.khinsider.com`) by:
